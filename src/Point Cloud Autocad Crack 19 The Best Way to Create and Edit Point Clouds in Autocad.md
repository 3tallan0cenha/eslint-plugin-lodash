Point clouds are collections of 3D points that represent the shape of an object or a scene. They are often generated by laser scanners or photogrammetry software, and can be used for various applications such as surveying, modeling, and visualization.
  
AutoCAD 2019 is a powerful computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software, the worldâs leading 2D and 3D CAD application tools[^2^]. It allows you to create, visualize, document, and share your ideas like never before. However, working with large and complex point clouds in AutoCAD can be challenging and time-consuming.
